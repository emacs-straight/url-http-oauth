GNU Emacs url-http-oauth NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* New in url-http-oauth 0.8.2

Released 2023-05-09

Warning: To handle refresh tokens, url-http-oauth needs to delete
entries from netrc files listed in the `auth-sources' variable.
Please back up all files listed in the `auth-sources' variable before
trying url-http-oauth 0.8.1 because the netrc entry deletion code is
new and relatively untested.  Deletion respects the customization
value of `auth-source-save-behavior'; if it is set to `ask', you will
be prompted before the entry deletion happens.

** Prevent url-oauth-auth throwing an error in the default case.
